### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Create Question Suggestion Tests](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_37-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/createQuestionSuggestion.js)
 - [Accept Question Suggestion Tests](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_37-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/teacher/acceptQuestionSuggestion.js)
 - [Reject Question Suggestion Tests](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_37-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/teacher/rejectQuestionSuggestion.js)

#### Rationale
Our end-to-end tests the creation of a question suggestion and all the possible methodes to accept and reject a suggestion. 
This is relevant because we need to test if our feactures work as intended.
We also test all the possible invalid inputs that a user can do.
This is also revelant because our feacture can only work well if it doens´t allow the user to do invalid actions, for example, reject an already accepted suggestion.

#### Rationale
Our end-to-end tests allow testing of the Clarification Requests creation and its answers by students and teachers.
This is a very important feature in our project and the tests show how the interaction between students and teachers work.
Right now we are making sure all the possible inputs are handled, keeping the user informed of the behaviour of the system.
