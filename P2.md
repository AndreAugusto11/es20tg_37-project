#### Discussion of findings

After performing tests, we verified that access to the database is what takes more time.
Some optimizations can be made in the creation of new question suggestions in terms of database access, by taking the load of also creating new questions from the creation service and puting it the acceptence service.
These changes will be made in the next sprint.

#### Discussion of findings

We found a possible optimization in the user repository, where we could
search by id instead of searching by username. We are thinking of
implementing this change in one of the next sprints.

#### Discussion of findings

For our EnrollInOpenTournament Load is based on the fact that different students (with different ids) are trying to enroll. However the demo student always logged in as 676 and therefore (so as to simulate the real behaviour) we added a condition to the code of the enroll method in the tournamentService that enables only the demo student (id 676) to enroll once again in a tournament without throwing the already enrolled exception.
